# ðŸŽ’ðŸ““ðŸ’» Task 1

**NOTE: If you just fork this repository it will not be graded. Ask your supervisor for a special GitHub classroom URL.**

## How to do the task

Your task is to write a valid definition for every function declared in `src/Task.hs`. All functions have a comment describing what the function needs to do with some examples.

There are predefined tests for you to check your answer. You can look at the tests for some more usage examples in `test/Tests.hs`.

After defining all functions you then need to commit **and push** your code to your repository. An automated script will then check your solution and give you feedback as a CI result in your GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

### Haskell Stack

First of all, you need to install [haskell stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). To do that you can follow the [installation instructions on the website](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install).

Stack will manage to install the compiler and all required libraries when you try to compile a Haskell stack project. (The first time it might take a while, but when you will try to run it again, it will use the already installed tools).

Stack is also a sort of meta build system. It is "meta" because stack doesn't build anything -- it tells *cabal* how to build your project with the installed compiler and libraries. *Cabal* is to Haskell what the *CMake* is to C++.

### Git

If you are running macOS or Linux you should already have some version of git installed on your system. If you do not, or if you are running windows, you will need to install git. You can do so by following this [git installation tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

## Cloning your project

After you follow the special URL, you should finally end up on your github project.

You will then want to grab the cloning URL:

And in you terminal, navigate to where you would like to store your project and clone the git repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hse-cs-2020/sc-task-1-ilyakooo0.git
```

### Making sure it builds

After you have cloned your project you should make sure you have everything set up and working properly.

Navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

This should download the compiler, download all necessary libraries and run the test in your project.

## Build and test

All subsequent commands are assumed to be run when the current directory is the root of your project.

After you have installed stack, you can build your project by running `stack build` in the directory of your project. This will build the code of your library.

To run tests on your code you can write `stack test`.

**NOTE: you don't have to write `stack build` if you want to test your project. Running `stack test` will automatically build any necessary modules.**

You can experiment with your functions by running `stack ghci`. This will build your library and launch an interactive shell with all of the functions already loaded. You can then just call your functions directly.

### Lifehack

If you try to display your types in the console, you will get errors.

To get rid of the errors you have to add `deriving Show` to the definition like so:

```haskell
data Foo = Bar
  deriving Show
```

## FAQ

> Can I add extra functions in the `Task.hs` file?

Yes, you can, but you can not remove existing functions.
